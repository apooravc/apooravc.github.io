                                                     <p>I'm Apoorv and this is my blog where I share my notes on physics, math, astronomy and experience in both technical and general aspects of life. I made this blog primarily because of sharing whatever I've learnt till now and I will keep adding content as much useful as possible.</p>
                                                     <p>What I'd like to do as a professional is to build things and improve my skills in software development-particularly web development.</p>
                                                     <p>I'd write here a bit more about me. I like photography; I clicked both-the silver lining of clouds (on "projects" page) and of birds resting on trusses (on "blog" page)-inside DTU's campus. I would add a collection of my photographs soon. My beloved genre in music are rock & punk, though I occasionally listen to piano and cello as well. Sometimes, I write poetry as well. And if you ask me what I like to do most of the time, my response would be-always learning.</p>
